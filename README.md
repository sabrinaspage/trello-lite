A minimalist task management board inspired by Trello, designed for hands-free productivity. Move cards between columns, like "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done", using simple voice commands instead of dragging and dropping.

Key features:
- Clean, distraction-free interface with customizable columns
- Voice commands like "Move [task name] to Done" or "Add new task: Call the dentist"
- Ideal for users with mobility limitations, multitaskers, or anyone who wants to update their board while their hands are busy
